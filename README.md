# Java Binance API

This is a fork of the original [Java Binance API](https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-java-api).

This fork was made primarily because the original library is not actively maintained and does not 
support some endpoints necessary for Profit-Loss (PNL) reports.

See the [docs for the original library](https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-java-api).
